# React Practice Projects

This repository contains multiple small React projects and experiments I built while learning React.  
Each folder represents different practice tasks and concepts such as states, props, hooks, forms, and API fetching.

##  Folder Structure
- **basic-react-app** → My very first React setup and basic components.  
- **react-practice** → Practice with functional components, JSX, and rendering elements.  
- **react-states-class** → Learning `useState` and handling state changes in functional components.  
- **react-states-class2** → Advanced practice with state, event handling, and multiple components.  

##  Features Practiced
- JSX basics
- Props and Component communication
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Conditional rendering
- Forms and input handling
- Fetching data from APIs (like random joke API)
- Small interactive components
